Whenever you create any new page, component, section, or module, you must strictly follow the existing UI, visual language, and design system of the project.
Do NOT introduce a new design style unless explicitly instructed.

🎨 1. Colors & Theme

Use only existing project colors (backgrounds, primary, secondary, accent).

Do not introduce new colors, gradients, or random shades.

If unsure, reuse colors from existing pages/components.

Maintain the same light/dark balance and contrast level.

🧩 2. Components Reuse Rule

Reuse existing:

Buttons

Input fields

Cards

Modals

Badges

Dropdowns

Do not redesign components if they already exist.

If a new component is required, design it to visually match existing components:

Same border radius

Same padding & spacing

Same hover & active effects

🔠 3. Typography

Use the same font family everywhere.

Follow existing:

Font sizes

Font weights

Line heights

Headings, labels, and body text must look consistent across all pages.

📐 4. Spacing & Layout

Follow existing:

Section spacing

Card spacing

Grid system

Align elements exactly like existing pages.

No overcrowded UI, no extra gaps.

✨ 5. Animations & Effects

Use animations only if they already exist in the project.

Match:

Animation type

Duration

Easing

Avoid flashy or unnecessary motion.

📱 6. Responsive Behavior Rule

Maintain existing responsive behavior.

Desktop UI changes should not affect mobile UI unless explicitly told.

Breakpoints must match the current project structure.

🧠 7. Design Decision Rule

Before creating anything new, you must:

Observe existing pages

Identify the current UI pattern

Replicate the same pattern

If there is any confusion, ask before changing UI style.

🚫 Strictly Not Allowed

❌ Random UI styles
❌ New color palettes
❌ Different button shapes
❌ Different card designs
❌ Inconsistent spacing or fonts

✅ Final Instruction

The goal is that a user should NOT be able to tell which page or module was added later.
Every new UI must feel like it always belonged to the project.
